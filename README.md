## FAQ

#### Is this a virus?

I understand you're getting an error message saying the app might be a virus.  However, I can assure you that there's a good chance it's a false positive. Many antivirus programs can mistakenly flag safe applications, especially those that are new or less well-known.

#### Does this work with tstore too?

Yes, but ensure that game is running in the background, so issues wont happen.

#### I found a bug and a error. what should i do?

Open a issue.
